# Pattern Matcher 

## Project info

🚀 Pattern Matcher  Interactive DFA Visualization Tool Excited to share my latest project - a comprehensive web application that brings Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and string pattern matching algorithms to life through interactive visualization! 🔍 What it does: • Real-time DFA Construction: Automatically builds DFA state diagrams from any input pattern using KMP-style algorithms • Interactive Simulation: Step-by-step visualization of pattern matching with O(n) time complexity • Educational Tool: Perfect for computer science students learning automata theory and string algorithms • Clean UI/UX: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations and intuitive controls 🛠 Technical Highlights: • React + Vite for blazing-fast development and performance • Custom SVG Rendering for dynamic state diagram generation • Algorithm Implementation: KMP failure function with optimized DFA construction • Real-time Simulation Engine with playback controls and speed adjustment • Responsive Design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components 📚 Key Features: ✅ Dynamic DFA state diagram visualization ✅ Interactive transition table generation ✅ Step-by-step pattern matching simulation ✅ Educational theory section with explanations ✅ Support for any pattern/text combination ✅ Mobile-responsive design This project demonstrates the practical application of theoretical computer science concepts in an accessible, visual format. It's particularly valuable for educators teaching automata theory and students learning string matching algorithms. Perfect for anyone interested in algorithms, data structures, automata theory, or educational technology!
